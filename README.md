# Project Overview

I currently have projects for [Python](https://github.com/JesseHilario/JesseHilario.github.io/tree/main/Python), [R](https://github.com/JesseHilario/JesseHilario.github.io/tree/main/R), and [SQL](https://github.com/JesseHilario/JesseHilario.github.io/tree/main/SQL), accessible in the above folders.

## Python

### Machine Learning algorithms from scratch

**Apriori vs Brute Force Algorithms:**
I generated [transactional sample data](https://github.com/JesseHilario/JesseHilario.github.io/blob/main/Python/Apriori%20vs%20Brute%20Force%20Algorithms/example_data/example_data.py) to create random itemsets, in order to build my algorithm. I compared the run times between [Brute Force](https://github.com/JesseHilario/JesseHilario.github.io/blob/main/Python/Apriori%20vs%20Brute%20Force%20Algorithms/Brute_Force/__init__.py) and [Apriori](https://github.com/JesseHilario/JesseHilario.github.io/blob/main/Python/Apriori%20vs%20Brute%20Force%20Algorithms/Apriori/__init__.py) using this dataset. Apriori's pruning of nonfrequent itemsets allowed it to outperform the Brute Force method by order of magnitudes, taking less than 1 second to mine association rules.



## R

### Project 1
[**Case Study Bellabeat**](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jessehilario/case-study-bellabeat)

My first project was the capstone for the Google Data Analytics Certification. Using Rstudio, I processed and cleaned data to analyze and visualize trends in smart device usage in order to make high-level recommendations for Bellabeat marketing strategy.

The following visualisations were made using the package ggplot2:

## SQL

### Project 2
[**Querying COVID-19 data**](https://github.com/JesseHilario/JesseHilario.github.io/tree/main/SQL/2022_covid_project)

My second project  utilized MySQL Workbench 8.0 CE. I engaged in data exploration, observing trends in infections, deaths, and vaccinations across time, location, and income level. Afterward, I created Views to be used for later viz's. Project inspired by [Alex the Analyst](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfyynHBFOsM&t=285s) on YouTube.


## Tableau

### Project 3
[**Visualising COVID-19 Data**](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jesse.hilario/viz/CovidProject_16627538263150/Dashboard1?publish=yes)

For my third project I used Tableau Public to visualise COVID-19 data using the Views created from Project 2. I created a dashboard that graphed data using maps, tables, and line and bar charts.
