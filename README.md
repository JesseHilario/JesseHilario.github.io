# Project Overview

I currently have projects for [R](https://github.com/JesseHilario/JesseHilario.github.io/tree/main/R) and [SQL](https://github.com/JesseHilario/JesseHilario.github.io/tree/main/SQL), accessible in the above folders.

## R

### Project 1
[Case Study Bellabeat](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jessehilario/case-study-bellabeat)

My first project was the capstone for the Google Data Analytics Certification. Using Rstudio, I processed and cleaned data to analyze and visualize trends in smart device usage in order to make high-level recommendations for Bellabeat marketing strategy.

The following visualisations were made using the package ggplot2:

## SQL

### Project 2
**Querying COVID-19 data**

My second project was inspired by [Alex the Analyst](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfyynHBFOsM&t=285s) on YouTube. I chose to use MySQL for this project.  You can find the SQL script by clicking [HERE](https://github.com/JesseHilario/JesseHilario.github.io/tree/main/SQL/2022_covid_project).
