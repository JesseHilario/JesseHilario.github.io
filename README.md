# Jesse Hilario

***
## Mission

My name is Jesse Hilario and I have recently completed the Google Data Analytics Cerfitication on Coursera. This certificate has prepared me for a career in data analysis by training me in the data analysis process (ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, act) by learning to use tools including SQL, Google Sheets, RStudio, and Tableau. I chose to use R for my capstone and am currently working on more projects to hone my SQL and Python.

I have a strong background in social science research with two years of experience working as a research assistant in undergraduate. I am looking to apply my skills and interest in statistics and data visualization in domains outside of academia and research.

I have a passion for psychology and sports--I would love to work on a project with you in those areas! On this page you can find my projects along with links and summary statements.

My first project was the capstone for the Google Data Analytics Certification. Using R, I processed and cleaned data to analyze and visualize trends in smart device usage in order to make high-level recommendations for Bellabeat marketing strategy.
