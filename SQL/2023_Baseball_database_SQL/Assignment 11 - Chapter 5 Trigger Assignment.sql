--  The 3rd step is to write a trigger that updates the
-- both of the columns you created in the PEOPLE table whenever there is a row inserted, updated
-- or deleted from the FIELDING table. The trigger name must start with your UCID and the DDL
-- that creates the trigger must also check to see if the trigger exists before creating it.
-- The trigger must use basic math functions (+, -) to adjust UCID_Total_G_Played. Youâ€™ll need to
-- use the INSERTED and DELETED tables to get the values to add or subtract. You can use the
-- appropriate aggregate functions and the FIELDING table to adjust/recalculate the
-- UCID_Career_Range_Factor column correctly.

-- Your answer must also include the queries necessary to verify your trigger works correctly. This
-- would typically include 3 sets of queries. One each for Insert, Delete and Update commands.
-- Each set would have the following pattern. The firsts query would select the columns from the
-- PEOPLE and FIELDING tables.

--  The 2nd query would perform the insert, update or delete function
-- on the FIELDING table.

--  The 3rd query would select the columns from the PEOPLE and FIELDING
