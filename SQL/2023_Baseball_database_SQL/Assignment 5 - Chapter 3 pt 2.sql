-- 3. You get into a debate regarding the level of school that professional sports players attend. Your stance
-- is that there are plenty of baseball players who attended Ivy League schools and were good batters in
-- addition to being scholars. Write a query to support your argument using the CollegePlaying and Batting
-- tables. You must use an IN clause in the WHERE clause to identify the Ivy League schools. Write a query
-- that shows the playerid, namefirst, namelast, schoolid, yearid (from batting table), home runs (HR), at
-- bats (AB) and batting average(h/ab) for the players who attended Ivy League Schools. Your results
-- should be sorted by the #of HR in descending order and the batting yeardis also in descending order.
-- Note the yearid is the year for the batting average not the year in College Playing. The colleges in the Ivy
-- League are Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Harvard, Princeton, UPenn, and Yale. You will need to
-- use the People, Batting and Collegeplaying tables. Your query should return 1,573 rows ( 1,823 using

-- League schools. Modify your query from #3 to show the playerid, namefirst, namelast, schoolid, total
-- HR and Total Salary. You will also need to use LEFT JOINS so players without salary information (salary
-- information started to be collected in the 1980s) do not drop out of the result set. Make sure your

-- under 500 but more than 400 home runs will have over 500 home runs, assuming they will play for a
-- total of 22 years like the top players in question 7. To create your estimates, divide the total number of
-- home runs by the years played and multiply by 22. Use a BETWEEN clause in the HAVING statement to
-- identify players having between 400 and 499 home runs. Only include playeris you estimate will reach
-- the 500 HR goal. This will return 18 rows

-- playerids, the players full name and the team names who in 2022 that were playing on teams that
-- existed prior to 1900. You should use the appearances table to identify the players years and the TEAMS

-- 11. Using the Salaries table, find the players full name, average salary and the last year they played for
